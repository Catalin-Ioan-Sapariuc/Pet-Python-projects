# Pet-Python-projects
Various Python codes used both for honing my Python skills and hopefully for creating something of use . 
I expect these codes to grow and change in time. 
Currently this repository contains the following programs: 
-- quadraticeqsolver.py
-- nonlinearsolver.py 
Description about each program is provided in their respective headers.
